Written in reference to the brief provided during the AND Digital interview process. This project aims to demonstrate competency and flexibility with Terraform and AWS through the deployment of a simple web front end.
## Table of Contents
## The Brief
+ Terraform a load balanced web front end in AWS, GCP or Azure.
+ The solution should incorporate a number of elements
+ There should be a minimum of 2 instances and they need to be able to scale across availability zones.
+ Ideally the web page should be secure.
+ The Vpc should be appropriately split into the required subnets.
+ The hosts should be running Linux and the choice of web server is down to the individual.
+ The use of modules would be a good step but the focus should be on good terraform structure.
